To monitor Windows Machines you will need to follow several steps and they are:

Install NSClient++ addon on the Windows Machine.
Configure Nagios Server for monitoring Windows Machine.
Add new host and service definitions for Windows machine monitoring.
Restart the Nagios Service.


STEP 1 Downloading & installing NSclient++
We can download the latest version of NSclient++ from following link on the windows machine https://sourceforge.net/projects/nscplus/

======================================================================
STEP 2 Configuring Nagios server

 open nagios configuration file,
$ vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg

&  uncomment the following line

# Definitions for monitoring a Windows machine
cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/windows.cfg

/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/windows.cfg  is the file where we will add information about our Windows hosts. Now we will edit the windows.cfg file

$ vim /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/windows.cfg

A sample host definition is already present in the file, we can either copy it or edit it to point to our windows machine


define host{
        use             windows-server  ; Inherit default values from a template
        host_name       winserver       ; The name we're giving to this host
        alias           My Windows Server       ; A longer name associated with the host
        address         192.168.1.103    ; IP address of the host
        }


:wq

verify the Nagios configuration files for any erros.
/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg


restart the Nagios service.

# service nagios restart

Open browser and verify hosts
