Kubernetes:
- Kubernetes is an open-source container management tool which automates container deployment, container scaling & load balancing.
- It schedules, runs and manages isolated containers which are running on virtual/physical/cloud machines.
- All top cloud service providers support kubernetes.

History:
- Google developed an internal system called Borg (latex named as Omega) to deploy and manage thousands of google application and services on their cluster.
- In 2014, google introduced kubernetes an open source platform written in “Golang” and later donated to CNFC (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)

Online Platform for learn K8S
- Kubernets playground 
- Play with k8s
- Play with kubernetes classroom

Cloud based k8s services
- GKE – Google Kubernetes services
- AKS – Azure Kubernetes services
- Amazon Eks – Elastic Kubernets Services

Kubernetes installation tools
- Minikube
- Kubeadm

Why k8S:

Problem with scaling up the containers:
- Containers cannot communicate with each other.
- Auto scaling and Load Balancing was not possible.
- Containers had to be managed carefully.

Features of Kubernetes
- Orchestration (clustering of any number of containers running on different n/w)
- Auto Scaling
- Auto- healing
- Load Balancing
- Platform Independent (cloud/virtual/physical)
- Fault Tolerance (Node / POD Failure)
- Rollback (going back to previous version)
- Health monitoring of containers
- Batch Execution (one time, sequential, parallel)

Compare Kubernetes & Docker Swarm
----------------------------------------------------------
Kubernets:
1.	Installation process is complicated and time consuming
2.	It can work with almost all containers types like Rocket, Docker, ContainerD etc
3.	GUI version available
4.	Only shared with containers in same POD
5.	Process scheduling to maintain services while updating
6.	Support vertical and horizontal autoscaling
7.	Inbuilt tool present for monitoring and log

Docker Swarm:
1.	Installation process is fast and easy.
2.	It can work with only docker container
3.	GUI version not available
4.	Can be shared with any other container.
5.	Progressive updates of services health monitoring throughout the update.
6.	Not support Auto scaling
7.	Used 3rd party tools like splunk
Apache Marathon also competitor of kubernetes and Docker Swarm
