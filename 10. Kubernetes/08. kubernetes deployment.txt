Kubernetes deployment and rollback:

Replication controller and Replica set is not able to update and rollback apps in the cluster.
Deployment object act as a supervisor for pods, giving you fin-graned control over how and when a new pod is rolled out, updated or rolled back to a previous state.
when using deployment object,we first define the state of the app, then k8s cluster schedules mentioned app instance onto specific individual nodes.
k8s then monitors,if the node hosting an instance goes down or pod is deleted the deployment controller replacess it.
This provides a self-healing machanism to address machine failure or maintainance.

The following are typical use cases of deployments-
1. create a deployment to rollout a replicaset - replicaset create creates pods in the backgroup check the status of the rollout to see if it succeed or not.
2. Declare the new state of the pods- by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the deploment. A new Replicaset is created and the deployment manages moving the pods from the old replicaset to the new one at a controlled  rate, Each new replicaset udates the revision of the deployment.
3. Rollback to an earlier deployment revision- if the current state of the deployment is not stable each rollback updates the deployment.
4. Scale up the deployment to facilitates more load.
5. Pause the deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new Rollout.
6. Cleanup older replicasets that you dont need anymore.
